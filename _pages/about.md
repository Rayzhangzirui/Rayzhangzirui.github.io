I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/mathematical-sciences) at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)](https://www.wpi.edu/)
Before this role, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Irvine, mentored by [John Lowengrub](https://www.math.uci.edu/people/john-lowengrub). I obtained my Ph.D. at UC San Diego, advised by [Li-Tien Cheng](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~lcheng/), co-advised by [Bo Li](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~bli/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree from the University of Hong Kong.
